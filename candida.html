<article class="right"><h3>Candida Alvarez</h3>
	<p>Candida Alvarez was born in 1955, grew up in New York City, and moved to Chicago in the late 1990's.  Since establishing herself as an artist in the 1980's, Alvarez has expanded on a conceptually rich, intuitive process of building abstract paintings.  Alvarez's breadth of practice incorporates drawings, photography, and printmaking. Alvarez's work is included in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, The Museum of Contemporary Art, The Virginia Museum of Art, and The Whitney Museum of American Art.  She is the 2021 recipient of the Helen Frankenthaler Award for Painting and the 2019 Joan Mitchell Foundation award recipient. Alvarez currently lives and works in Baroda, MI and Chicago, IL.</p>
